# PROJECT SUMMARY:

The World Happiness Report dataset provides comprehensive data on the happiness levels of various countries from 2005 to the present. The dataset contains information on life satisfaction, economic indicators, social factors, and other variables that contribute to the overall happiness of a country.

In this project, SQL server was utilized to analyze the dataset and uncover patterns and relationships between different factors contributing to happiness. The first challenge encountered was handling null values in the dataset. Since the data was collected on the same countries for several years, removing rows with null values was not ideal. Instead, null values were retained in the analysis as they would be ignored in calculations using SQL and Tableau.

Key findings from the analysis include:

- Denmark consistently ranked among the top 10 happiest countries in the world every year.

- North America and Western Europe were identified as the top two happiest regions overall.

- Latin American countries made up the majority of nations with low GDP but high happiness scores, potentially due to factors such as social support and freedom.

- The United States and the United Arab Emirates, despite ranking among the top ten countries with the highest GDP per capita, had significantly lower life expectancies compared to other countries with high GDP per capita.

These findings provide valuable insights into the factors that contribute to a country's happiness and emphasize the importance of considering various aspects beyond economic indicators.
